# School Management System - Complete System Architecture
(a demo software based on microservices architecture)
# Executive Summary
The proposed school management system architecture follows a microservices-based approach with cloud-native deployment, designed to handle the complex requirements of educational institutions. The system provides separate portals for different user roles while maintaining data consistency and security across all modules.

# System Architecture Overview

# Architecture Pattern
The system employs a microservices architecture with the following key benefits:
* Independent scalability of each service based on demand
* Technology diversity allowing optimal tech stack selection per service
* Fault isolation preventing system-wide failures
* Parallel development enabling faster delivery cycles

# Core Architectural Layers
# 1. Frontend Layer (Client-Side Applications)
  * Public Website: React.js-based responsive website
  * Student Portal: Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile-first experience
  * Teacher Portal: Desktop-optimized React application
  * Admin Portal: Comprehensive management dashboard
  * Principal Portal: Executive dashboard with analytics

# 2. API Gateway Layer
  * Authentication Service: JWT-based token management
  * Rate Limiting: API throttling and abuse prevention
  * Request Routing: Intelligent routing to appropriate microservices
  * Load Balancing: Traffic distribution across service instances

# 3. Microservices Layer
  Ten specialized microservices handle distinct business domains:
  * User Management Service
  * Student Management Service
  * Teacher Management Service
  * Academic Service
  * Examination Service
  * Attendance Service
  * Financial Service
  * Communication Service
  * Library Service
  * Reporting Service
